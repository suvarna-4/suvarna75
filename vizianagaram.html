        <h3 class="e"><u>TADKA</u></h3>
        <p>Tadka (known as tempering in English) is the base for all your favourite Indian dishes. This Punjabi tadka is specific to North Indian food and is used in all dal, sabzi, and gravy based dishes like curry chicken. It’s pefect to batch up and freeze also. 


            <h4>RECIPE:</h4>
    <ul>
       <li> Try to cut your onions and tomatoes as uniform as possible. The texture of the tadka is much better if they are all similar sizes.</li>
<li>Use a heavy bottomed pan when making this tadka recipe. You are cooking on high heat and the tadka can burn quite easily.</li>
<li> It really only takes 30-45 seconds for whole spices to “bloom”, keep stirring, and pull them off the heat if you think they might burn!</li>
<li>Take your time with the onions and tomatoes. It’s tempting to turn the heat up and try to cook them faster, but the real magic happens when you let them caramelize and brown slowly.</li>
<li>Don’t add your dry spices until yo add the tomatoes, otherwise they will burn.</li>
<li>The most important part of making a tadka is to manage the temperature of the flame or element you are cooking. Medium to high is the sweet spot for me.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="e"><u>MIRCHI BAJJI</u></h3>
<p>This is one of those recipes in which, you will be able to enjoy chillies without their spiciness. Thus, this Mirchi Bajji is also a popular one at my home and I make it on many occasions. Since, there’s no heat from the chilies in this recipe, it is liked by one and all. There are many variations, like the Mirchi Vada and Mirchi Pakoda famous in Northern and Western India. But the Chilli Bajji is quite a distinct one from Southern India.
    
    <h4>RECIPE:</h4>
    <ul>
       <li> Slit the green chilli lengthwise in an L shape as shown in the video. Do not slice them in half, only make a small slit creating a pocket. Using a spoon or your finger, scrape out the seeds inside and veins inside.</li>
<li>Repeat this with the remaining green chillies. Use a spoon to stuff the chillies with the prepared fillings. Set aside.</li>
<li>Heat 1 ½ inch oil in a kadhai on a medium high flame upto 350-375F.</li>
<li>Dip the stuffed chillies in the prepared batter and carefully drop it into the hot oil. Fry for 4-6 minutes on medium flame or until golden brown.</li>
<li>Use a skimmer or a slotted spoon to remove the fried chilli bajjis and transfer to a tissue lined plate. Serve along with some mint coriander chutney or ketchup or just have it as is!</li>
