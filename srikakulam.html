        <h3 class="e"><u>UTANKI</u></h3>
       <p>Utanki is a rice crepe recipe specific to Srikakulam region of Andhra and Odisha. It is a hand made crepe recipe and hence demands fine skill. This sweet fritter-like crepe can be served as snack. Utanki, a heirloom recipe from my Grandma, stays fresh for a week when stored in an airtight container.
    <h4>RECIPE:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>To prepare Utanki (Crispy Rice Crepes Recipe) get ready with all the ingredients required. In a big bowl, add rice flour, sugar, milk- one after the other.</li>

<li>Mix well until the sugar melts and ensure that lumps are not formed. Keep this aside  for 4 hours to ferment.</li>

<li>After 4 hours, grind this mixed paste in a mixer grinder for 20-30 minutes to form a much smoother batter. Note that the batter should be medium and not too thick or thin in consistency. </li> 

<li>Once string like consistency is obtained of the batter, transfer it into a deep bowl.</li>

<li>Heat oil in a pan over a medium flame.</li>

<li>Once the oil is hot, dip your clean hand into the batter. Drop the batter with your hand in swift circular motions 3 or 4 times such that the batters form strings on the hot oil and a crepe like form is formed on hot oil.</li>
<li>Fry till the color of the crepe/utanki is golden brown and then remove the crepe on to a kitchen towel, with the help of a perforated ladle, draining the excess oil back into the deep frying pan. Roll them up with the help of a rolling pin immediately, such that they harden in that shape when cooled.</li>

<li>Utanki (Crispy Rice Crepes Recipe) can be stored away in an airtight box upto a week and munch during tea time. </li>   
</ul>
